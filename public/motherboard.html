                    A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer. The motherboard is a computer's central communications backbone connectivity point, through which all components and external peripherals connect.

Motherboards can be found in virtually all computers, especially desktop and laptop PCs. The components that connect through them include chipsets, central processing units (CPU) and memory. The external peripherals include Wi-Fi, Ethernet and graphics cards with the graphics processing unit, or GPU.

Motherboard manufacturers include Acer, ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte Technology, Intel and Micro-Star International.

                History of MotherBoard:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <p>
                        A motherboard is a complex printed circuit board (PCB), which is the main part of almost all electronic systems, particularly computers. It is alternately known as the mainboard, system board, or even logic board (Apple Computers). It is a platform that offers electrical connections through which other components of a computer communicate, and also houses the central processing unit (CPU), which is referred to as the brain of the computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Motherboards are also available in mobile phones, clocks, stopwatches, etc. They consist of a lot of essential components of a computer like a microprocessor, main memory, and the microprocessor's supporting chipset that gives an interface between the CPU and other external components.

                    <p>
                        
                    Let us throw some light on the history of Motherboard.
                    
                    The invention of the motherboard happened gradually, with time. It went through a lot of upgradation as early computers used to perform limited tasks.

                <h1>
                    Types of MotherBoard:
                </h1>
                <p>
                <p>
                    To comprehend what motherboards are and what they do, we must first examine their various types and specifications.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    1. Advanced Technology (AT) motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Due to their larger physical dimensions (which can be measured in hundredths of millimeters), these motherboards do not work properly with computers that fall into the category of smaller desktops. A larger physical size makes it more difficult to install new hardware drivers. 

The power connections on these motherboards are in the form of sockets and plugs with six prongs each. Due to the difficulty in recognizing these power connections, users often have issues while trying to connect and operate them. In the 1980s, motherboards of this sort were all the rage, and they continued to be manufactured far into the 2000s.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Standard ATX motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    ATX is an enhanced version of the AT motherboard that Intel created in the 1990s. Its name means “advanced technology extended,” and its initials stand for “advanced technology.” Unlike AT, it is much more compact and enables the associated components to be interchanged. The connection elements have witnessed significant progress and development.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Micro ATX motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The length and width of these motherboards, measured in millimeters, are also 244 mm (size metrics will differ as per the manufacturer). This motherboard has fewer ports and slots than the Standard ATX board.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users who do not want excessive connections and subsequent upgrades, like adding more RAM, an extra GPU, or other Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) cards, are better suited for this kind of motherboard than others. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This motherboard may be installed in any case with enough space to accommodate 244 mm by 244 mm. It can also be installed in larger cases that are compatible with Standard ATX or eXTENDED ATX motherboards.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    eXtended ATX motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The dimensions of this motherboard are 344 millimeters by 330 millimeters (dimensions will differ with different manufacturers). This motherboard supports a single or a twin CPU configuration and has up to eight RAM slots. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Flex ATX motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    These ATX Form Factor mainboards do not enjoy the same degree of popularity as their ATX Form Factor counterparts. They are the ones within the ATX family that are considered the most compact. They were designed to occupy a minimal amount of space and had a minimal price tag. Flex ATX is a modification of mini ATX that Intel created between 1999-2000. It is a motherboard standard.
                </p>
                <h3>Low-Profile EXtended (LPX) motherboard</h3>
                <p>In comparison to previous iterations, this has two significant enhancements. The first change was that the output and input ports were moved to the rear of the device, and the second change was the addition of a riser card, which enables the device to have additional slots and makes it easier to attach components. </p>
                <h3>BTX motherboard</h3>
                <p>
                    Balanced technology extended, abbreviated as BTX, is a strategy developed to fulfill the requirements of emerging technologies, which call for increased power consumption and, as a result, emanate more heat. During the middle of the 2000s, Intel ceased the future production of BTX boards to concentrate on low-power CPUs.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Mini ITX motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that there is no regular-sized version of the information technology extended (ITX) motherboard. In its place, the motherboard has been downsized into a more compact form than in earlier iterations. It was developed in the 2000s, and its measurements are 17 by 17 centimeters. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Mini STX motherboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The name “Intel 5*5” was initially given to the motherboard now known as the Mini-STX, which stands for mini socket technology extended. Although it was introduced in 2015, the motherboard has dimensions of 147 millimeters by 140 millimeters. This converts to a length of 5.8 inches and a width of 5.5 inches; hence, the 5*5 name is rather misleading. 
                </p>
