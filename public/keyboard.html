                    <p>
                        Keyboards are also integrated into mobile devices, calculators, and various electronic systems. They consist of keys for letters, numbers, and symbols, and function keys that provide additional features.

                    Let us delve into the history of keyboards.
                    
                    Keyboards evolved from mechanical typewriters over time, with each advancement adding to their functionality and efficiency. From QWERTY to modern ergonomic layouts, the keyboard has seen significant innovations.

                    Types of Keyboards:
                </h1>
                <p>
                <p>
                    To understand keyboard functionality and design, letâ€™s look at some common types of keyboards.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    1. Mechanical Keyboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Mechanical keyboards use individual mechanical switches for each key, making them durable and preferred by typists and gamers for their tactile feedback.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Membrane Keyboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Membrane keyboards use pressure pads that are less durable but more affordable, commonly found in most consumer-grade keyboards.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Virtual Keyboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    These are software-based keyboards displayed on touchscreens, such as on tablets and smartphones. They provide flexibility and portability.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Ergonomic Keyboard
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Designed to reduce strain, ergonomic keyboards come in various shapes that promote natural hand positioning for more comfortable typing.
                </p>

                    Each keyboard type is designed to accommodate specific layouts, such as QWERTY or DVORAK, and may include additional features, like media control keys.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keyboards often include the following components:

                        <li><b>Keys</b> for typing, including alphabets, numbers, and symbols;</li>
                        <li><b>Function keys</b> for executing specific tasks like volume control or launching applications;</li>
                        <li><b>Backlight</b> that illuminates keys, enhancing visibility in low-light settings;</li>
                        <li><b>Key switches</b> that vary by type, providing different levels of tactile feedback;</li>
                        <li><b>USB or wireless connectivity</b> that links the keyboard to the computer;</li>
                        <li><b>Power source</b> (for wireless keyboards) to operate the device;</li>
                        <li><b>Battery compartment</b> (for wireless models) that houses the power source;</li>
                    </ul>
